# Hello there !!👋


I am a undergrad engineering student, specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE). With a profound enthusiasm for programming💻 and a keen interest in hardware learning and implementation🦿.   

-------

👩‍💻In the first year of my engineering I focused on improving my programming and logical skills using C++ language and sometimes using C. In 2022 I learned basic Front-end languages HTML, CSS, JS and created my very first own website. 
🐍 Applied my Python language skills to learn data science. Gained knowledge on various python libraries that are used for data manipulation and visualization📊 and at the end did a project on dataset about penguins!
⌨️ Also learned SQL and implemented it on the Oracle Database. It was really a fasinating experience to know how a records get inserted in the database and how you can retrive them. It also gave me a brief idea on how the databases work.

✏️I do skeching and painting as my hobby, though its been a long time since I painted something as I mostly go with sketching. Lately I have been into digital art more using Ibis Paint.
