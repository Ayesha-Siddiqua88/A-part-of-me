# Hello there !!![HelloGIF](https://github.com/Ayesha-Siddiqua88/A-part-of-me/assets/128472306/a820a267-2ed5-4f0e-b8c8-6a9fd31c19ff)


I am a undergrad engineering student, specializing in Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE). 
# With a profound enthusiasm for programming💻 and a keen interest in hardware learning and implementation🦿.   

👩‍💻In the first year of my engineering I focused on improving my programming and logical skills using C++ language and sometimes using C. In 2022 I learned basic Front-end languages HTML, CSS, JS and created my very first own website. 

🐍 Applied my Python language skills to learn data science. Gained knowledge on various python libraries that are used for data manipulation and visualization📊 and at the end did a project on dataset about penguins!

⌨️ Also learned SQL and implemented it on the Oracle Database. It was really a fasinating experience to know how a records get inserted in the database and how you can retrive them. It also gave me a brief idea on how the databases work.
